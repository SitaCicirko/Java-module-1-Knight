# Java-module-1-Knight
You have a unique challenge in front of you. This time, your goal will be to write a program
that displays information about the completion of certain tasks (quests) by a certain knight.
To do this, create the following elements in your application:

A Quest interface that will contain a process() method.
Two task classes - DeadIslandQuest and EliteKnightQuest that implement the Quest interface. Use the System.out.println() command.
Create a Knight class that will take different tasks that implement the Quest interface in its constructor.
In the Knight class, create any method that will call the process() method of the Quest interface.
The main program should display information about the completion of a specific task along with its name.
